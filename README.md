# Car-Data-Analysis
● Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing on a dataset of more than 10,000 records, resulting in 10% reduction in missing data and improved accuracy for data analysis.

● Explored the relationship between car’s features, market categories and pricing using regression analysis and determined the features to be worked upon in future to increase the profitability by 2x for the manufacturer.

● Built Power BI dashboard to communicate key insights to business stakeholders, resulting in improved decision making and saving 10 hours per week of manual work.

● Created documentation for data cleaning and analysis processes, resulting in increased efficiency and reproducibility of data analysis tasks.

Analyzed the relationship between a car's features, market category, and pricing, and identifying which features and categories are most popular among consumers and most profitable for the manufacturer.

Used regression analysis and market segmentation, to develop a pricing strategy for manufacturer that balances consumer demand with profitability, and identify which product features to focus on in future product development efforts.

Following insights were drawn for this project -

How does the popularity of a car model vary across different market categories?

What is the relationship between a car's engine power and its price?

Which car features are most important in determining a car's price?

How does the average price of a car vary across different manufacturers?

What is the relationship between fuel efficiency and the number of cylinders in a car's engine?
